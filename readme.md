Monitor for MAC addresses and signal strength from a variety of devices:
 - CDMA
 - GSM
 - Bluetooth
 - 802.11

Additionally monitor for patterns of wide band spectral emission.  Categorize
this information by time and place during some training phase.

Once this is complete, this system can monitor for outliers during periods of
time where outliers are not permitted (such as 4AM outside of your home).  If
conditions such as this are met, it indicates the presence of a mobile device
that perhaps should not be present.  In effect acting as a burgler alarm.

Monitoring for odd usage patterns during extended periods of time away would be
helpful.

Multiple receiving stations could be used to passively locate signal sources
based on time difference of arrival allowing for localization of transmission
source enabling geo fencing and pattern matching based on time, position, and
power.

Would-be intruders would be forced to utilize unconventional communications
techniques in the event they were aware of this sort of survelliance system.

A single receiving station on a large piece of property equipped with high gain
antennas and sensitive receivers could secure a very large area.  Combined with
conventional optical survelliance this could be used to capture video footage
of potential trespassers in a similar manner ground survelliance radar is used
with directional optical systems.

High false postive rates could be filtered with different antenna
configurations, increased signal power limits, increased loiter time
requirements or detection from another source.
